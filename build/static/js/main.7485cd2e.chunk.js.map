It was described as “a sativa dominant hybrid, with some indica effects that mostly come in the form of couch lock,” which is not exactly appealing-sounding to me. I think it turned out as a great “night-time” sativa. For me it’s the ideal sendoff to dreamland, although you may find it better suited to a slightly early time in the evening - paired with ‘un digestif’, perhaps, enjoyed as part of an end to your evening meal. Sadly, this plant was part of a failed experiment resulting in a low yield, and samples are especially limited.`,\n    img: '',\n  },\n  Sour_Deisel: {\n    name: 'Sour Deisel',\n    blurb: `A perennial classic, this plant provides a boost to mood and energy, providing a good headspace adjustment without too much mind-bendiness, and no lethargy. “Great day-time weed,” is what most folks say, and it’s true. Perfectly suited to hiking, yoga, playing music, getting those fall leaves raked, or any number of adventures. I find this to be a good socially stimulating strain, for conversation or parties.

Many of the folks who got to try the batch of this really enjoyed it, although it isn’t one of my personal favorites. Probably a good choice for many to help decompress or “shift gear” ofter work or similar activity. If you want to completely space out mentally, this is a good choice.`,\n    img: '',\n  },\n  Magic_Medicine: {\n    name: 'Magic Medicine',\n    blurb: `A very special cultivar (it’s a hybrid of two sativa landrace strains, Panama Red and Malana Cream), packing a powerful punch-in-the-brain in the brain-department - the high borders on psychedelic. The fragrance boasts an unique and pleasing aroma, with notes of honeysuckle, melon, and an “old school spiciness”.  I find this strain is great for creative activities, helping to both inspire my imagination and energize my artistic faculties. Or use it for a mini vision quest. This is easily one of my favorite strains of cannabis I’ve ever enjoyed. (I’d be happy to expound upon the fascinating history and linage of the Magic Medicine cultivar to anybody curious to learn more.) It’s unlikely you’ve had something quite like this one before. If you have, it wasn’t recently.
