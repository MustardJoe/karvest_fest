  Obama_Kush: {
    name: 'Obama Kush',
    blurb: 'One of the few indica-dominant strains I really enjoy, this strain is a modern classic, much like the plant’s namesake. I find Obama Kush offers a powerfully physical, relaxing body high, without sending me to insta-snooze land. And yet it still has definite, strong Sativa notes that come through in the shape of a thought-expanding introspectiveness. It’s an excellent strain for those who appreciate cannabis for both its medicinal/therapeutic qualities as well as recreational enjoyment. This is a great late-evening strain for me, but one I also like at other times as well, as the physical effects help to melt stress out of my body. Great for watching cartoons, hanging out by the fire with friends, or a long soak in the tub (my personal suggestion), this strain is likely to appeal to a variety of folks turning to cannabis for any number of reasons. Solid gold. This particular phenotype has produced incredible looking buds, so frosty and purple… absolutely gorgeous.',

  Magic_Medicine_2: {
    name: 'Magic Medicine',
    blurb: 'A plant so nice, I grew it twice! And I’m very glad I did. This is one of my favorite strains ever: a lesser known, newer introduction by a small-scale grower of rare landrace and landrace-hybrid cultivars that are specifically acclimated for outdoor growing in Pacific Northwest climates. Truly unique! Unfortunately the farmer who produced this strain suffered devastating property destruction and crop losses from the 2020 Oregon wildfires, and has dropped of the map. I managed to take a cutting of the plant I grew outdoors last summer, and so was able to grow the strain a second time. I absolutely love Magic Medicine and I hope the farmer can make a comeback over the next year or so. A 100% Sativa cross between Panama Red and the Malana cultivar, strongly psychedelic, as far as cannabis goes. Excellent strain for making art/music and other creative stuff. ',

  Nightmare_Cookies: {
    name: 'Nightmare Cookies',
    blurb: `I didn’t think I would like this one as much as I do. It was described as “a sativa dominant hybrid, with some indica effects that mostly come in the form of couch lock,” which is not exactly appealing-sounding to me. I think it turned out as a great “night-time” sativa. For me it’s the ideal sendoff to dreamland, although you may find it better suited to a slightly early time in the evening - paired with ‘un digestif’, perhaps, enjoyed as part of an end to your evening meal. Sadly, this plant was part of a failed experiment resulting in a low yield, and samples are especially limited.`,

  Sour_Deisel: {
    name: 'Sour Deisel',
    blurb: `A perennial classic, this plant provides a boost to mood and energy, providing a good headspace adjustment without too much mind-bendiness, and no lethargy. “Great day-time weed,” is what most folks say, and it’s true. Perfectly suited to hiking, yoga, playing music, getting those fall leaves raked, or any number of adventures. I find this to be a good socially stimulating strain, for conversation or parties. Eventually we will get to have those again. `,

  Bruce_Banner: {
    name: 'Bruce Banner #3',
    blurb: `This is a mentally energizing, and at the same time curiously, a profoundly calming high. This is the most chill of any of the strains I’ve grown this summer, but it is still definitely not a “chill out” strain. Many of the folks who got to try the last batch of this really enjoyed it, although it isn’t one of my personal favorites. Probably a good choice for many to help decompress or “shift gear” ofter work or similar. If you want to completely space out mentally, this is a good choice.`,

  Magic_Medicine: {
    name: 'Magic Medicine',
    blurb: `A very special cultivar (it’s a hybrid of two sativa landrace strains, Panama Red and Malana Cream), packing a powerful punch-in-the-brain in the brain-department - the high borders on psychedelic. The fragrance boasts an unique and pleasing aroma, with notes of honeysuckle, melon, and an “old school spiciness”.  I find this strain is great for creative activities, helping to both inspire my imagination and energize my artistic faculties. Or, use it for a mini vision quest. This is easily one of my favorite strains of cannabis I’ve ever enjoyed. (I’d be happy to expound upon the fascinating history and linage of the Magic Medicine cultivar to anybody curious to learn more.) It’s unlikely you’ve had something quite like this one before. If you have, it wasn’t recently. However, if you aren’t a fan of strong sativas, or especially if you are prone to weed induced paranoia, this may not be the strain for you.`,
