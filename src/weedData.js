    name: 'Nightmare Cookies',
    blurb: `I didn’t think I would like this one as much as I did, it was
    described as “a sativa dominant hybrid, with some indica effects that
    mostly come in the form of couch lock.” I think of it as great 
    “night-time sativa,” for me, the ideal send off to dream land. Sadly,
    the total yield from this plant was rather low, and samples are
    especially limited.`,

  Sour_Deisel: {
    name: 'Sour Deisel',
    blurb: `A perennial classic, this plant provides a boost to mood and
    energy, and a good headspace adjustment, without too much
    mind-bendiness, and no lethargy. “Great day-time weed” is what most
    folks say, and it’s true. Well suited to hiking, yoga, playing or
    listening to music, or getting those fall leaves raked. Personally,
    I find this to be a good socially stimulating strain, for
    conversation or parties. Eventually we will get to have those again.`,

  Bruce_Banner: {
    name: 'Bruce Banner #3',
    blurb: `This is a mentally energizing, and at the same time, curiously-
    also still a profoundly calming high. This is the most chill of any of
    these strains, but it is still definitely not a “chill out” strain.
    Many of the folks who got to try the last batch of this strain I grew
    said they really enjoyed it, although it isn’t one of my personal
    favorites. Probably best suited to video games, watching stuff and
    similar activities. If you really just want to space out mentally,
    this is a good choice.`,

  Magic_Medicine: {
    name: 'Magic Medicine',
    blurb: `This is a very special strain (A hybrid of 2 Sativa landrace
      strains, I’d be happy to tell you more about it for any curious folks),
      and it packs a powerful punch in the brain-department, with a high
      bordering on psychedelic.  I find this strain is great for creative
      activities, helping to both inspire my imagination and energize my
      artistic and musical faculties. This is easily one of my favorite
      strains of cannabis I’ve ever enjoyed. However, if you aren’t a fan of
      strong sativas, or especially if you are prone to weed induced paranoia,
      this may not be the strain for you.`,
